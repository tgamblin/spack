"""This package contains directives that can be used within a package.

Directives are functions that can be called inside a package
definition to modify the package, for example:

    class OpenMpi(Package):
        depends_on("hwloc")
        provides("mpi")
        ...

``provides`` and ``depends_on`` are spack directives.

The available directives are:

  * ``version``
  * ``depends_on``
  * ``provides``
  * ``extends``
  * ``patch``
  * ``variant``
  * ``resource``

    """Decorator for Spack directives.

    Spack directives allow you to modify a package while it is being
    defined, e.g. to add version or dependency information.  Directives
    are one of the key pieces of Spack's package "language", which is
    embedded in python.

    Here's an example directive:

        @directive(dicts='versions')
        version(pkg, ...):
            ...

    This directive allows you write:

        class Foo(Package):
            version(...)

    The ``@directive`` decorator handles a couple things for you:

      1. Adds the class scope (pkg) as an initial parameter when
         called, like a class method would.  This allows you to modify
         a package from within a directive, while the package is still
         being defined.

      2. It automatically adds a dictionary called "versions" to the
         package so that you can refer to pkg.versions.

    The ``(dicts='versions')`` part ensures that ALL packages in Spack
    will have a ``versions`` attribute after they're constructed, and
    that if no directive actually modified it, it will just be an
    empty dict.

    This is just a modular way to add storage attributes to the
    Package class, and it's how Spack gets information from the
    packages to the core.
